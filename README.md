# odin-etch-a-sketch

Another Odin Project. The Etch-A-Sketch clears with a button, and we can change the resolution (number of rows) with a number input. I will note that I didn't make the screen a square, but instead used an aspect ratio of 3:2, which I think looks nicer, and is closer to the real Etch-A-Sketch, I think. 

TODOS: 
1. get the knobs to work with arrow keys (plus hit collision on the sides)
2. maybe try to put the pen up and down on clicking the screen, or pressing some key
3. introduce color, as the project notes suggested
4. make the whole thing responsive
