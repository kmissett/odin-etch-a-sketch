# odin-etch-a-sketch

Another Odin Project. The Etch-A-Sketch clears with a button, and we can change the resolution (number of rows) with a number input.

TODOS: 
1. basic CSS for the number input and the button
2. get the Etch-A-Sketch to shake when we clear the screen
3. get the knobs to work with arrow keys (plus hit collision on the sides)
4. maybe try to put the pen up and down on clicking the screen, or pressing some key
5. introduce color, as the project notes suggested
